# Ad Client  
for my [Ad REST API](https://github.com/TomyMMX/ad-server). Written with [Angluar(v2)](http://angular.io).

## Description
The scaffolding for this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).  
If you have Angular CLI installed run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigating to `http://localhost:4200/` will open the app.  

Unfourtunatelly I don't have the Ad server running for outside use, so here is a gif showing the client in action.
